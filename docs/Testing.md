# Testing Approach and Improvement Opportunities

## 1. Testing Approach

In our project, we use three main levels of testing:

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions or components in isolation.
- Aim to quickly detect logic errors within small code units.
- We use libraries such as **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- These tests are fast to run and help maintain quality during development.

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between multiple components or modules.
- Verify that parts work together as expected.
- These tests are slower than unit tests but provide confidence in component collaboration.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Test full flows through the application, from UI to backend services.
- Simulate real user behavior in a realistic environment.
- We recommend modern E2E tools like **Vitest + Playwright** or **Cypress**.

## 2. Best Practices for Unit and Integration Tests

- **Write tests alongside feature development** — testing should be part of the development process, not an afterthought.
- **Cover critical and complex logic** — focus on business logic and component interactions.
- **Use mocks and stubs wisely** — keep tests fast and isolated.
- **Write clear and maintainable tests** — test names should clearly describe what is being tested.

## 4. Suggestions for Improvement

- Introduce **Vitest + Playwright** or **Cypress**. for covering key E2E user flows, leveraging its cross-browser capabilities.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to run tests automatically on pull requests and merges, enabling faster feedback and safer deployments.
- Regularly review and refactor tests to keep them relevant and efficient.
